# YouMIX

## <3 Alvraw

I love you man

## MAIN DIRECTORY

I changed the main directory to youmix, maybe you will need to run "run pip install -r requirements.txt" in the git base directory to run the 'app.py' with beats, bpm_google, bpm_librosa, onset_frames, onset_times

## Notes

I put notes about the musics_data in resource/notes, 
that's not very useful now, but in the future maybe we can use it

## TO DO LIST

Please, write tasks for me here

1. Find a free database with many musics bpm's data

2. Sync the playback with the music automatically by second

3. Identify the introduction from the musics or anythings otherwise the music itself, and start the playback with the music

4. Remake the app with both ways to run after tests
